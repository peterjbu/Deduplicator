The Project Gutenberg EBook of Song of the Lark, by Willa Cather

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the t123 one day when she took Bowers home in her
carriage, "How handsome your afternoon girl would be if she did not have
that unfortunate squint; it gives her that vacant Swede look, like an
animal." That amused Bowers. He liked to watch the germination and
growth of antipathies.


One of the first disappointments Thea had to face when she returned to
Chicago that fall, was the news that the Harsanyis were not coming back.
They had spent the summer in a camp in the Adirondacks and were moving
to New York. An old teacher and friend of Harsanyi's, one of the
best-known piano teachers in New York, was about to retire because of
failing health and had arranged to turn his pupils over to Harsanyi.
Andor was to give two recitals in New York in November, to devote
himself to his new students until spring, and then to go on a short
concert tour. The Harsanyis had taken a furnished apartment in New York,
as they would not attempt to settle a place of their own until Andor's
recitals were over. The first of December, however, Thea received a note
from Mrs. Harsanyi, asking her to call at the old studio, where she was
packing their goods for shipment.

The morning after this invitation reached her, Thea climbed the stairs
and knocked at the familiar door. Mrs. Harsanyi herself opened it, and
embraced her visitor warmly. Taking Thea into the studio, which was
littered with excelsior and packing-cases, she stood holding her hand
and looking at her in the strong light from the big window before she
allowed her to sit down. Her quick eye saw many changes. The girl was
taller, her figure had become definite, her carriage positive. She had
got used to living in the body of a young woman, and she no longer tried
to ignore it and behave as if she were a little girl. With that
increased independence of body there had come a change in her face; an
indifference, something hard and skeptical. Her clothes, too, were
different, like the attire of a shopgirl who tries to follow the
fashions; a purple suit, a piece of cheap fur, a three-cornered purple
hat with a pompon sticking up in front. The queer country clothes she
used to wear suited her much better, Mrs. Harsanyi thought. But such
trifles, after all, were accidental and remediable. She put her hand on
the girl's strong shoulder.

"How much the summer has done for you! Yes, you are a young lady at
last. Andor will be so glad to hear about you."

Thea looked about at the disorder of the familiar room. The pictures
were piled in a corner, the piano and the CHAISE LONGUE were gone. "I
suppose I ought to be glad you have gone away," she said, "but I'm not.
It's a fine thing for Mr. Harsanyi, I suppose."

Mrs. Harsanyi gave her a quick glance that said more than words. "If you
knew how long I have wanted to get him away from here, Miss Kronborg! He
is never tired, never discouraged, now."

Thea sighed. "I'm glad for that, then." Her eyes traveled over the faint
discolorations on the walls where the pictures had hung. "I may run away
myself. I don't know whether I can stand it here without you."

"We hope that you can come to New York to study before very long. We
have thought of that. And you must tell me how you are getting on with
Bowers. Andor will want to know all about it."

"I guess I get on more or less. But I don't like my work very well. It
never seems serious as my work with Mr. Harsanyi did. I play Bowers's
accompaniments in the afternoons, you know. I thought I would learn a
good deal from the people who work with him, but I don't think I get
much."

Mrs. Harsanyi looked at her inquiringly. Thea took out a carefully
folded handkerchief from the bosom of her dress and began to draw the
corners apart. "Singing doesn't seem to be a very brainy profession,
Mrs. Harsanyi," she said slowly. "The people I see now are not a bit
like the ones I used to meet here. Mr. Harsanyi's pupils, even the dumb
ones, had more--well, more of everything, it seems to me. The people I
have to play accompaniments for are discouraging. The professionals,
like Katharine Priest and Miles Murdstone, are worst of all. If I have
to play 'The Messiah' much longer for Mrs. Priest, I'll go out of my
mind!" Thea brought her foot down sharply on the bare floor.

Mrs. Harsanyi looked down at the foot in perplexity. "You mustn't wear
such high heels, my dear. They will spoil your walk and make you mince
along. Can't you at least learn to avoid what you dislike in these
singers? I was never able to care for Mrs. Priest's singing."

Thea was sitting with her chin lowered. Without moving her head she
looked up at Mrs. Harsanyi and smiled; a smile much too cold and
desperate to be seen on a young face, Mrs. Harsanyi felt. "Mrs.
Harsanyi, it seems to me that what I learn is just TO DISLIKE. I dislike
so much and so hard that it tires me out. I've got no heart for
anything." She threw up her head suddenly and sat in defiance, her hand
clenched on the arm of the chair. "Mr. Harsanyi couldn't stand these
people an hour, I know he couldn't. He'd put them right out of the
window there, frizzes and feathers and all. Now, take that new soprano
they're all making such a fuss about, Jessie Darcey. She's going on tour
with a symphony orchestra and she's working up her repertory with
Bowers. She's singing some Schumann songs Mr. Harsanyi used to go over
with me. Well, I don't know what he WOULD do if he heard her."

"But if your own work goes well, and you know these people are wrong,
why do you let them discourage you?"

Thea shook her head. "That's just what I don't understand myself. Only,
after I've heard them all afternoon, I come out frozen up. Somehow it
takes the shine off of everything. People want Jessie Darcey and the
kind of thing she does; so what's the use?"

Mrs. Harsanyi smiled. "That stile you must simply vault over. You must
not begin to fret about the successes of cheap people. After all,
what have they to do with you?"

"Well, if I had somebody like Mr. Harsanyi, perhaps I wouldn't fret
about them. He was the teacher for me. Please tell him so."

Thea rose and Mrs. Harsanyi took her hand again. "I am sorry you have to
go through this time of discouragement. I wish Andor could talk to you,
he would understand it so well. But I feel like urging you to keep clear
of Mrs. Priest and Jessie Darcey and all their works."

Thea laughed discordantly. "No use urging me. I don't get on with them
AT ALL. My spine gets like a steel rail when they come near me. I liked
them at first, you know. Their clothes and their manners were so fine,
and Mrs. Priest IS handsome. But now I keep wanting to tell them how
stupid they are. Seems like they ought to be informed, don't you think
so?" There was a flash of the shrewd grin that Mrs. Harsanyi remembered.
Thea pressed her hand. "I must go now. I had to give my lesson hour this
morning to a Duluth woman who has come on to coach, and I must go and
play 'On Mighty Pens' for her. Please tell Mr. Harsanyi that I think
oratorio is a great chance for bluffers."

Mrs. Harsanyi detained her. "But he will want to know much more than
that about you. You are free at seven? Come back this evening, then, and
we will go to dinner somewhere, to some cheerful place. I think you need
a party."

Thea brightened. "Oh, I do! I'll love to come; that will be like old
times. You see," she lingered a moment, softening, "I wouldn't mind if
there were only ONE of them I could really admire."

"How about Bowers?" Mrs. Harsanyi asked as they were approaching the
stairway.

"Well, there's nothing he loves like a good fakir, and nothing he hates
like a good artist. I always remember something Mr. Harsanyi said about
him. He said Bowers was the cold muffin that had been left on the
plate."

Mrs. Harsanyi stopped short at the head of the stairs and said
decidedly: "I think Andor made a mistake. I can't believe that is the
right atmosphere for you. It would hurt you more than most people. It's
all wrong."

"Something's wrong," Thea called back as she clattered down the stairs
in her high heels.




II

DURING that winter Thea lived in so many places that sometimes at night
when she left Bowers's studio and emerged into the street she had to
stop and think for a moment to remember where she was living now and
what was the best way to get there.

When she moved into a new place her eyes challenged the beds, the
carpets, the food, the mistress of the house. The boarding-houses were
wretchedly conducted and Thea's complaints sometimes took an insulting
form. She quarreled with one landlady after another and moved on. When
she moved into a new room, she was almost sure to hate it on sight and
to begin planning to hunt another place before she unpacked her trunk.
She was moody and contemptuous toward her fellow boarders, except toward
the young men, whom she treated with a careless familiarity which they
usually misunderstood. They liked her, however, and when she left the
house after a storm, they h4elped her to move her things and came to see
her after she got settled in a new place. But she moved so often that
they soon ceased to follow her. They could see no reason for keeping up
with a girl who, under her jocularity, was cold, self-centered, and
unimpressionable. They soon felt that she did not admire them.

Thea used to waken up in the night and wonder why she was so unhappy.
She would have been amazed if she had known how much the people whom she
met in Bowers's studio had to do with her low spirits. She had never
been conscious of those instinctive standards which are called ideals,
and she did not know that she was suffering for them. She often found
herself sneering when she was on a street-car, or when she was brushing
out her hair before her mirror, as some inane remark or too familiar
mannerism flitted across her mind.

She felt no creature kindness, no tolerant good-will for Mrs. Priest or
Jessie Darcey. After one of Jessie Darcey's concerts the glowing press
notices, and the admiring comments that floated about Bowers's studio,
caused Thea bitter unhappiness. It was not the torment of personal
jealousy. She had never thought of herself as even a possible rival of
Miss Darcey. She was a poor music student, and Jessie Darcey was a
popular and petted professional. Mrs. Priest, whatever one held against
her, had a fine, big, showy voice and an impressive presence. She read
indifferently, was inaccurate, and was always putting other people
wrong, but she at least had the material out of which singers can be
made. But people seemed to like Jessie Darcey exactly because she could
not sing; because, as they put it, she was "so natural and
unprofessional." Her singing was pronounced "artless," her voice
"birdlike." Miss Darcey was thin and awkward in person, with a sharp,
sallow face. Thea noticed that her plainness was accounted to her
credit, and that people spoke of it affectionately. Miss Darcey was
singing everywhere just then; one could not help hearing about her. She
was backed by some of the packing-house people and by the Chicago
Northwestern Railroad. Only one critic raised his voice against her.
Thea went to several of Jessie Darcey's concerts. It was the first time
she had had an opportunity to observe the whims of the public which
singers live by interesting. She saw that people liked in Miss Darcey
every quality a singer ought not to have, and especially the nervous
complacency that stamped her as a commonplace young woman. They seemed
to have a warmer feeling for Jessie than for Mrs. Priest, an
affectionate and cherishing regard. Chicago was not so very different
from Moonstone, after all, and Jessie Darcey was only Lily Fisher under
another name.

Thea particularly hated to accompany for Miss Darcey because she sang
off pitch and didn't mind it in the least. It was excruciating to sit
there day after day and hear her; there was something shameless and
indecent about not singing true.

One morning Miss Darcey came by appointment to go over the programme for
her Peoria concert. She was such a frail-looking girl that Thea ought to
have felt sorry for her. True, she had an arch, sprightly little manner,
and a flash of salmon-pink on either brown cheek. But a narrow upper jaw
gave her face a pinched look, and her eyelids were heavy and relaxed. By
the morning light, the purplish brown circles under her eyes were
pathetic enough, and foretold no long or brilliant future. A singer with
a poor digestion and low vitality; she needed no seer to cast her
horoscope. If Thea had ever taken the pains to study her, she would have
seen that, under all her smiles and archness, poor Miss Darcey was
really frightened to death. She could not understand her success any
more than Thea could; she kept catching her breath and lifting her
eyebrows and trying to believe that it was true. Her loquacity was not
natural, she forced herself to it, and when she confided to you how many
defects she could overcome by her unusual command of head resonance, she
was not so much trying to persuade you as to persuade herself.

When she took a note that was high for her, Miss Darcey always put her
right hand out into the air, as if she were indicating height, or giving
an exact measurement. Some early teacher had told her that she could
"place" a tone more surely by the help of such a gesture, and she firmly
believed that it was of great assistance to her. (Even when she was
singing in public, she kept her right hand down with difficulty,
nervously clasping her white kid fingers together when she took a high
note. Thea could always see her elbows stiffen.) She unvaryingly
executed this gesture with a smile of gracious confidence, as if she
were actually putting her finger on the tone: "There it is, friends!"

This morning, in Gounod's "Ave Maria," as Miss Darcey approached her B
natural:--

DANS--NOS--A--LAR--MES!

Out went the hand, with the sure airy gesture, though it was little
above A she got with her voice, whatever she touched with her finger.
Often Bowers let such things pass--with the right people--but this
morning he snapped his jaws together and muttered, "God!" Miss Darcey
tried again, with the same gesture as of putting the crowning touch,
tilting her head and smiling radiantly at Bowers, as if to say, "It is
for you I do all this!"


DANS--NOS A--LAR------MES!

This time she made B flat, and went on in the happy belief that she had
done well enough, when she suddenly found that her accompanist was not
going on with her, and this put her out completely.

She turned to Thea, whose hands had fallen in her lap. "Oh why did you
stop just there! It IS too trying! Now we'd better go back to that other
CRESCENDO and try it from there."

"I beg your pardon," Thea muttered. "I thought you wanted to get that B
natural." She began again, as Miss Darcey indicated.

After the singer was gone, Bowers walked up to Thea and asked languidly,
"Why do you hate Jessie so? Her little variations from pitch are between
her and her public; they don't hurt you. Has she ever done anything to
you except be very agreeable?"

"Yes, she has done things to me," Thea retorted hotly.

Bowers looked interested. "What, for example?"

"I can't explain, but I've got it in for her."

Bowers laughed. "No doubt about that. I'll have to suggest that you
conceal it a little more effectually. That is--necessary, Miss
Kronborg," he added, looking back over the shoulder of the overcoat he
was putting on.

He went out to lunch and Thea thought the subject closed. But late in
the afternoon, when he was taking his dyspepsia tablet and a glass of
water between lessons, he looked up and said in a voice ironically
coaxing:--

"Miss Kronborg, I wish you would tell me why you hate Jessie."

Taken by surprise Thea put down the score she was reading and answered
before she knew what she was saying, "I hate her for the sake of what I
used to think a singer might be."

Bowers balanced the tablet on the end of his long forefinger and
whistled softly. "And how did you form your conception of what a singer
ought to be?" he asked.

"I don't know." Thea flushed and spoke under her breath; "but I suppose
I got most of it from Harsanyi."

Bowers made no comment upon this reply, but opened the door for the next
pupil, who was waiting in the reception-room.

It was dark when Thea left the studio that night. She knew she had
offended Bowers. Somehow she had hurt herself, too. She felt unequal to
the boarding-house table, the sneaking divinity student who sat next her
and had tried to kiss her on the stairs last night. She went over to the
waterside of Michigan Avenue and walked along beside the lake. It was a
clear, frosty winter night. The great empty space over the water was
restful and spoke of freedom. If she had any money at all, she would go
away. The stars glittered over the wide black water. She looked up at
them wearily and shook her head. She believed that what she felt was
despair, but it was only one of the forms of hope. She felt, indeed, as
if she were bidding the stars good-bye; but she was renewing a promise.
Though their challenge is universal and eternal, the stars get no answer
but that,--the brief light flashed back to them from the eyes of the
young who unaccountably aspire.

The rich, noisy, city, fat with food and drink, is a spent thing; its
chief concern is its digestion and its little game of hide-and-seek with
the undertaker. Money and office and success are the consolations of
impotence. Fortune turns kind to such solid people and lets them suck
their bone in peace. She flecks her whip upon flesh that is more alive,
upon that stream of hungry boys and girls who tramp the streets of every
city, recognizable by their pride and discontent, who are the Future,
and who possess the treasure of creative power.




III

WHILE her living arrangements were so casual and fortuitous, Bowers's
studio was the one fixed thing in Thea's life. She went out from it to
uncertainties, and hastened to it from nebulous confusion. She was more
influenced by Bowers than she knew. Unconsciously she began to take on
something of his dry contempt, and to share his grudge without
understanding exactly what it was about. His cynicism seemed to her
honest, and the amiability of his pupils artificial. She admired his
drastic treatment of his dull pupils. The stupid deserved all they got,
and more. Bowers knew that she thought him a very clever man.

One afternoon when Bowers came in from lunch Thea handed him a card on
which he read the name, "Mr. Philip Frederick Ottenburg."

"He said he would be in again to-morrow and that he wanted some time.
Who is he? I like him better than the others."

Bowers nodded. "So do I. He's not a singer. He's a beer prince: son of
the big brewer in St. Louis. He's been in Germany with his mother. I
didn't know he was back."

"Does he take lessons?"

"Now and again. He sings rather well. He's at the head of the Chicago
branch of the Ottenburg business, but he can't stick to work and is
always running away. He has great ideas in beer, people tell me. He's
what they call an imaginative business man; goes over to Bayreuth and
seems to do nothing but give parties and spend money, and brings back
more good notions for the brewery than the fellows who sit tight dig out
in five years. I was born too long ago to be much taken in by these
chesty boys with flowered vests, but I like Fred, all the same."

"So do I," said Thea positively.

Bowers made a sound between a cough and a laugh. "Oh, he's a
lady-killer, all right! The girls in here are always making eyes at him.
You won't be the first." He threw some sheets of music on the piano.
"Better look that over; accompaniment's a little tricky. It's for that
new woman from Detroit. And Mrs. Priest will be in this afternoon."

Thea sighed. "'I Know that my Redeemer Liveth'?"

"The same. She starts on her concert tour next week, and we'll have a
rest. Until then, I suppose we'll have to be going over her programme."

The next day Thea hurried through her luncheon at a German bakery and
got back to the studio at ten minutes past one. She felt sure that the
young brewer would come early, before it was time for Bowers to arrive.
He had not said he would, but yesterday, when he opened the door to go,
he had glanced about the room and at her, and something in his eye had
conveyed that suggestion.

Sure enough, at twenty minutes past one the door of the reception-room
opened, and a tall, robust young man with a cane and an English hat and
ulster looked in expectantly. "Ah--ha!" he exclaimed, "I thought if I
came early I might have good luck. And how are you to-day, Miss
Kronborg?"

Thea was sitting in the window chair. At her left elbow there was a
table, and upon this table the young man sat down, holding his hat and
cane in his hand, loosening his long coat so that it fell back from his
shoulders. He was a gleaming, florid young fellow. His hair, thick and
yellow, was cut very short, and he wore a closely trimmed beard, long
enough on the chin to curl a little. Even his eyebrows were thick and
yellow, like fleece. He had lively blue eyes--Thea looked up at them
with great interest as he sat chatting and swinging his foot
rhythmically. He was easily familiar, and frankly so. Wherever people
met young Ottenburg, in his office, on shipboard, in a foreign hotel or
railway compartment, they always felt (and usually liked) that artless
presumption which seemed to say, "In this case we may waive formalities.
We really haven't time. This is to-day, but it will soon be to-morrow,
and then we may be very different people, and in some other country." He
had a way of floating people out of dull or awkward situations, out of
their own torpor or constraint or discouragement. It was a marked
personal talent, of almost incalculable value in the representative of a
great business founded on social amenities. Thea had liked him yesterday
for the way in which he had picked her up out of herself and her German
grammar for a few exciting moments.

"By the way, will you tell me your first name, please? Thea? Oh, then
you ARE a Swede, sure enough! I thought so. Let me call you Miss Thea,
after the German fashion. You won't mind? Of course not!" He usually
made his assumption of a special understanding seem a tribute to the
other person and not to himself.

"How long have you been with Bowers here? Do you like the old grouch? So
do I. I've come to tell him about a new soprano I heard at Bayreuth.
He'll pretend not to care, but he does. Do you warble with him? Have you
anything of a voice? Honest? You look it, you know. What are you going
in for, something big? Opera?"

Thea blushed crimson. "Oh, I'm not going in for anything. I'm trying to
learn to sing at funerals."

Ottenburg leaned forward. His eyes twinkled. "I'll engage you to sing at
mine. You can't fool me, Miss Thea. May I hear you take your lesson this
afternoon?"

"No, you may not. I took it this morning."

He picked up a roll of music that lay behind him on the table. "Is this
yours? Let me see what you are doing."

He snapped back the clasp and began turning over the songs. "All very
fine, but tame. What's he got you at this Mozart stuff for? I shouldn't
think it would suit your voice. Oh, I can make a pretty good guess at
what will suit you! This from 'Gioconda' is more in your line. What's
this Grieg? It looks interesting. TAK FOR DITT ROD. What does that
mean?"

"'Thanks for your Advice.' Don't you know it?"

"No; not at all. Let's try it." He rose, pushed open the door into the
music-room, and motioned Thea to enter before him. She hung back.

"I couldn't give you much of an idea of it. It's a big song."

Ottenburg took her gently by the elbow and pushed her into the other
room. He sat down carelessly at the piano and looked over the music for
a moment. "I think I can get you through it. But how stupid not to have
the German words. Can you really sing the Norwegian? What an infernal
language to sing. Translate the text for me." He handed her the music.

Thea looked at it, then at him, and shook her head. "I can't. The truth
is I don't know either English or Swedish very well, and Norwegian's
still worse," she said confidentially. She not infrequently refused to
do what she was asked to do, but it was not like her to explain her
refusal, even when she had a good reason.

"I understand. We immigrants never speak any language well. But you know
what it means, don't you?"

"Of course I do!"

"Then don't frown at me like that, but tell me."

Thea continued to frown, but she also smiled. She was confused, but not
embarrassed. She was not afraid of Ottenburg. He was not one of those
people who made her spine like a steel rail. On the contrary, he made
one venturesome.

"Well, it goes something like this: Thanks for your advice! But I prefer
to steer my boat into the din of roaring breakers. Even if the journey
is my last, I may find what I have never found before. Onward must I go,
for I yearn for the wild sea. I long to fight my way through the angry
waves, and to see how far, and how long I can make them carry me."

Ottenburg took the music and began: "Wait a moment. Is that too fast?
How do you take it? That right?" He pulled up his cuffs and began the
accompaniment again. He had become entirely serious, and he played with
fine enthusiasm and with understanding.

Fred's talent was worth almost as much to old Otto Ottenburg as the
steady industry of his older sons. When Fred sang the Prize Song at an
interstate meet of the TURNVEREIN, ten thousand TURNERS went forth
pledged to Ottenburg beer.

As Thea finished the song Fred turned back to the first page, without
looking up from the music. "Now, once more," he called. They began
again, and did not hear Bowers when he came in and stood in the doorway.
He stood still, blinking like an owl at their two heads shining in the
sun. He could not see their faces, but there was something about his
girl's back that he had not noticed before: a very slight and yet very
free motion, from the toes up. Her whole back seemed plastic, seemed to
be moulding itself to the galloping rhythm of the song. Bowers perceived
such things sometimes--unwillingly. He had known to-day that there was
something afoot. The river of sound which had its source in his pupil
had caught him two flights down. He had stopped and listened with a kind
of sneering admiration. From the door he watched her with a
half-incredulous, half-malicious smile.

When he had struck the keys for the last time, Ottenburg dropped his
hands on his knees and looked up with a quick breath. "I got you
through. What a stunning song! Did I play it right?"

Thea studied his excited face. There was a good deal of meaning in it,
and there was a good deal in her own as she answered him. "You suited
me," she said ungrudgingly.

After Ottenburg was gone, Thea noticed that Bowers was more agreeable
than usual. She had heard the young brewer ask Bowers to dine with him
at his club that evening, and she saw that he looked forward to the
dinner with pleasure. He dropped a remark to the effect that Fred knew
as much about food and wines as any man in Chicago. He said this
boastfully.

"If he's such a grand business man, how does he have time to run around
listening to singing-lessons?" Thea asked suspiciously.

As she went home to her boarding-house through the February slush, she
wished she were going to dine with them. At nine o'clock she looked up
from her grammar to wonder what Bowers and Ottenburg were having to eat.
At that moment they were talking of her.




IV

THEA noticed that Bowers took rather more pains with her now that Fred
Ottenburg often dropped in at eleven-thirty to hear her lesson. After
the lesson the young man took Bowers off to lunch with him, and Bowers
liked good food when another man paid for it. He encouraged Fred's
visits, and Thea soon saw that Fred knew exactly why.

One morning, after her lesson, Ottenburg turned to Bowers. "If you'll
lend me Miss Thea, I think I have an engagement for her. Mrs. Henry
Nathanmeyer is going to give three musical evenings in April, first
three Saturdays, and she has consulted me about soloists. For the first
evening she has a young violinist, and she would be charmed to have Miss
Kronborg. She will pay fifty dollars. Not much, but Miss Thea would meet
some people there who might be useful. What do you say?"

Bowers passed the question on to Thea. "I guess you could use the fifty,
couldn't you, Miss Kronborg? You can easily work up some songs."

Thea was perplexed. "I need the money awfully," she said frankly; "but I
haven't got the right clothes for that sort of thing. I suppose I'd
better try to get some."

Ottenburg spoke up quickly, "Oh, you'd make nothing out of it if you
went to buying evening clothes. I've thought of that. Mrs. Nathanmeyer
has a troop of daughters, a perfect seraglio, all ages and sizes. She'll
be glad to fit you out, if you aren't sensitive about wearing kosher
clothes. Let me take you to see her, and you'll find that she'll arrange
that easily enough. I told her she must produce something nice, blue or
yellow, and properly cut. I brought half a dozen Worth gowns through the
customs for her two weeks ago, and she's not ungrateful. When can we go
to see her?"

"I haven't any time free, except at night," Thea replied in some
confusion.

"To-morrow evening, then? I shall call for you at eight. Bring all your
songs along; she will want us to give her a little rehearsal, perhaps.
I'll play your accompaniments, if you've no objection. That will save
money for you and for Mrs. Nathanmeyer. She needs it." Ottenburg
chuckled as he took down the number of Thea's boarding-house.

The Nathanmeyers were so rich and great that even Thea had heard of
them, and this seemed a very remarkable opportunity. Ottenburg had
brought it about by merely lifting a finger, apparently. He was a beer
prince sure enough, as Bowers had said.

The next evening at a quarter to eight Thea was dressed and waiting in
the boarding-house parlor. She was nervous and fidgety and found it
difficult to sit still on the hard, convex upholstery of the chairs. She
tried them one after another, moving about the dimly lighted, musty
room, where the gas always leaked gently and sang in the burners. There
was no one in the parlor but the medical student, who was playing one of
Sousa's marches so vigorously that the china ornaments on the top of the
piano rattled. In a few moments some of the pension-office girls would
come in and begin to two-step. Thea wished that Ottenburg would come and
let her escape. She glanced at herself in the long, somber mirror. She
was wearing her pale-blue broadcloth church dress, which was not
unbecoming but was certainly too heavy to wear to anybody's house in the
evening. Her slippers were run over at the heel and she had not had time
to have them mended, and her white gloves were not so clean as they
should be. However, she knew that she would forget these annoying things
as soon as Ottenburg came.

Mary, the Hungarian chambermaid, came to the door, stood between the
plush portieres, beckoned to Thea, and made an inarticulate sound in her
throat. Thea jumped up and ran into the hall, where Ottenburg stood
smiling, his caped cloak open, his silk hat in his white-kid hand. The
Hungarian girl stood like a monument on her flat heels, staring at the
pink carnation in Ottenburg's coat. Her broad, pockmarked face wore the
only expression of which it was capable, a kind of animal wonder. As the
young man followed Thea out, he glanced back over his shoulder through
the crack of the door; the Hun clapped her hands over her stomach,
opened her mouth, and made another raucous sound in her throat.

"Isn't she awful?" Thea exclaimed. "I think she's half-witted. Can you
understand her?"

Ottenburg laughed as he helped her into the carriage. "Oh, yes; I can
understand her!" He settled himself on the front seat opposite Thea.
"Now, I want to tell you about the people we are going to see. We may
have a musical public in this country some day, but as yet there are
only the Germans and the Jews. All the other people go to hear Jessie
Darcey sing, 'O, Promise Me!' The Nathanmeyers are the finest kind of
Jews. If you do anything for Mrs. Henry Nathanmeyer, you must put
yourself into her hands. Whatever she says about music, about clothes,
about life, will be correct. And you may feel at ease with her. She
expects nothing of people; she has lived in Chicago twenty years. If you
were to behave like the Magyar who was so interested in my buttonhole,
she would not be surprised. If you were to sing like Jessie Darcey, she
would not be surprised; but she would manage not to hear you again."

"Would she? Well, that's the kind of people I want to find." Thea felt
herself growing bolder.

"You will be all right with her so long as you do not try to be anything
that you are not. Her standards have nothing to do with Chicago. Her
perceptions--or her grandmother's, which is the same thing--were keen
when all this was an Indian village. So merely be yourself, and you will
like her. She will like you because the Jews always sense talent, and,"
he added ironically, "they admire certain qualities of feeling that are
found only in the white-skinned races."

Thea looked into the young man's face as the light of a street lamp
flashed into the carriage. His somewhat academic manner amused her.

"What makes you take such an interest in singers?" she asked curiously.
"You seem to have a perfect passion for hearing music-lessons. I wish I
could trade jobs with you!"

"I'm not interested in singers." His tone was offended. "I am interested
in talent. There are only two interesting things in the world, anyhow;
and talent is one of them."

"What's the other?" The question came meekly from the figure opposite
him. Another arc-light flashed in at the window.
56is mother could look out; he was going to
make a scandal.

Mrs. Otto Ottenburg went to Kansas City to see Mr. Beers, and had the
satisfaction of telling him that he had brought up his daughter like a
savage, EINE UNGEBILDETE. All the Ottenburgs and all the Beers, and many
of their friends, were drawn into the quarrel. It was to public opinion,
however and not to his mother's activities, that Fred owed his partial
escape from bondage. The cosmopolitan brewing world of St. Louis had
conservative standards. The Ottenburgs' friends were not predisposed in
favor of the plunging Kansas City set, and they disliked young Fred's
wife from the day that she was brought among them. They found her
ignorant and ill-bred and insufferably impertinent. When they became
aware of how matters were going between her and Fred, they omitted no
opportunity to snub her. Young Fred had always been popular, and St.
Louis people took up his cause with warmth. Even the younger men, among
whom Mrs. Fred tried to draft a following, at first avoided and then
ignored her. Her defeat was so conspicuous, her life became such a
desert, that she at last consented to accept the house in Santa Barbara
which Mrs. Otto Ottenburg had long owned and cherished. This villa, with
its luxuriant gardens, was the price of Fred's furlough. His mother was
only too glad to offer it in his behalf. As soon as his wife was
established in California, Fred was transferred from St. Louis to
Chicago.

A divorce was the one thing Edith would never, never, give him. She told
him so, and she told his family so, and her father stood behind her. She
would enter into no arrangement that might eventually lead to divorce.
She had insulted her husband before guests and servants, had scratched
his face, thrown hand-mirrors and hairbrushes and nail-scissors at him
often enough, but she knew that Fred was hardly the fellow who would go
into court and offer that sort of evidence. In her behavior with other
men she was discreet.

After Fred went to Chicago, his mother visited him often, and dropped a
word to her old friends there, who were already kindly disposed toward
the young man. They gossiped as little as was compatible with the
interest they felt, undertook to make life agreeable for Fred, and told
his story only where they felt it would do good: to girls who seemed to
find the young brewer attractive. So far, he had behaved well, and had
kept out of entanglements.

Since he was transferred to Chicago, Fred had been abroad several times,
and had fallen more and more into the way of going about among young
artists,--people with whom personal relations were incidental. With
women, and even girls, who had careers to follow, a young man might have
pleasant friendships without being regarded as a prospective suitor or
lover. Among artists his position was not irregular, because with them
his marriageableness was not an issue. His tastes, his enthusiasm, and
his agreeable personality made him welcome.

With Thea Kronborg he had allowed himself more liberty than he usually
did in his friendships or gallantries with young artists, because she
seemed to him distinctly not the marrying kind. She impressed him as
equipped to be an artist, and to be nothing else; already directed,
concentrated, formed as to mental habit. He was generous and
sympathetic, and she was lonely and needed friendship; needed
cheerfulness. She had not much power of reaching out toward useful
people or useful experiences, did not see opportunities. She had no tact
about going after good positions or enlisting the interest of
influential persons. She antagonized people rather than conciliated
them. He discovered at once that she had a merry side, a robust humor
that was deep and hearty, like her laugh, but it slept most of the time
under her own doubts and the dullness of her life. She had not what is
called a "sense of humor." That is, she had no intellectual humor; no
power to enjoy the absurdities of people, no relish of their
pretentiousness and inconsistencies--which only depressed her. But her
joviality, Fred felt, was an asset, and ought to be developed. He
discovered that she was more receptive and more effective under a
pleasant stimulus than she was under the gray grind which she considered
her salvation. She was still Methodist enough to believe that if a thing
were hard and irksome, it must be good for her. And yet, whatever she
did well was spontaneous. Under the least glow of excitement, as at Mrs.
Nathanmeyer's, he had seen the apprehensive, frowning drudge of Bowers's
studio flash into a resourceful and consciously beautiful woman.

His interest in Thea was serious, almost from the first, and so sincere
that he felt no distrust of himself. He believed that he knew a great
deal more about her possibilities than Bowers knew, and he liked to
think that he had given her a stronger hold on life. She had never seen
herself or known herself as she did at Mrs. Nathanmeyer's musical
evenings. She had been a different girl ever since. He had not
anticipated that she would grow more fond of him than his immediate
usefulness warranted. He thought he knew the ways of artists, and, as he
said, she must have been "at it from her cradle." He had imagined,
perhaps, but never really believed, that he would find her waiting for
him sometime as he found her waiting on the day he reached the Biltmer
ranch. Once he found her so--well, he did not pretend to be anything
more or less than a reasonably well-intentioned young man. A lovesick
girl or a flirtatious woman he could have handled easily enough. But a
personality like that, unconsciously revealing itself for the first time
under the exaltation of a personal feeling,--what could one do but watch
it? As he used to say to himself, in reckless moments back there in the
canyon, "You can't put out a sunrise." He had to watch it, and then he
had to share it.

Besides, was he really going to do her any harm? The Lord knew he would
marry her if he could! Marriage would be an incident, not an end with
her; he was sure of that. If it were not he, it would be some one else;
some one who would be a weight about her neck, probably; who would hold
her back and beat her down and divert her from the first plunge for
which he felt she was gathering all her energies. He meant to help her,
and he could not think of another man who would. He went over his
unmarried friends, East and West, and he could not think of one who
would know what she was driving at--or care. The clever ones were
selfish, the kindly ones were stupid.

"Damn it, if she's going to fall in love with somebody, it had better be
me than any of the others--of the sort she'd find. Get her tied up with
some conceited ass who'd try to make her over, train her like a puppy!
Give one of 'em a big nature like that, and he'd be horrified. He
wouldn't show his face in the clubs until he'd gone after her and combed
her down to conform to some fool idea in his own head--put there by some
other woman, too, his first sweetheart or his grandmother or a maiden
aunt. At least, I understand her. I know what she needs and where she's
bound, and I mean to see that she has a fighting chance."

His own conduct looked crooked, he admitted; but he asked himself
whether, between men and women, all ways were not more or less crooked.
He believed those which are called straight were the most dangerous of
all. They seemed to him, for the most part, to lie between windowless
stone walls, and their rectitude had been achieved at the expense of
light and air. In their unquestioned regularity lurked every sort of
human cruelty and meanness, and every kind of humiliation and suffering.
He would rather have any woman he cared for wounded than crushed. He
would deceive her not once, he told himself fiercely, but a hundred
times, to keep her free.


When Fred went back to the observation car at one o'clock, after the
luncheon call, it was empty, and he found Thea alone on the platform.
She put out her hand, and met his eyes.

"It's as I said. Things have closed behind me. I can't go back, so I am
going on--to Mexico?" She lifted her face with an eager, questioning
smile.

Fred met it with a sinking heart. Had he really hoped she would give him
another answer? He would have given pretty much anything--But there,
that did no good. He could give only what he had. Things were never
complete in this world; you had to snatch at them as they came or go
without. Nobody could look into her face and draw back, nobody who had
any courage. She had courage enough for anything--look at her mouth and
chin and eyes! Where did it come from, that light? How could a face, a
familiar face, become so the picture of hope, be painted with the very
colors of youth's exaltation? She was right; she was not one of those
who draw back. Some people get on by avoiding dangers, others by riding
through them.

They stood by the railing looking back at the sand levels, both feeling
that the train was steaming ahead very fast. Fred's mind was a confusion
of images and ideas. Only two things were clear to him: the force of her
determination, and the belief that, handicapped as he was, he could do
better by her than another man would do. He knew he would always
remember her, standing there with that expectant, forward-looking smile,
enough to turn the future into summer.





PART V. DR. ARCHIE'S VENTURE




I

DR. HOWARD ARCHIE had come down to Denver for a meeting of the
stockholders in the San Felipe silver mine. It was not absolutely
necessary for him to come, but he had no very pressing cases at home.
Winter was closing down in Moonstone, and he dreaded the dullness of it.
On the 10th day of January, therefore, he was registered at the Brown
Palace Hotel. On the morning of the 11th he came down to breakfast to
find the streets white and the air thick with snow. A wild northwester
was blowing down from the mountains, one of those beautiful storms that
wrap Denver in dry, furry snow, and make the city a loadstone to
thousands of men in the mountains and on the plains. The brakemen out on
their box-cars, the miners up in their diggings, the lonely homesteaders
in the sand hills of Yucca and Kit Carson Counties, begin to think of
Denver, muffled in snow, full of food and drink and good cheer, and to
yearn for her with that admiration which makes her, more than other
American cities, an object of sentiment.

Howard Archie was glad he had got in before the storm came. He felt as
cheerful as if he had received a legacy that morning, and he greeted the
clerk with even greater friendliness than usual when he stopped at the
desk for his mail. In the dining-room he found several old friends
seated here and there before substantial breakfasts: cattlemen and
mining engineers from odd corners of the State, all looking fresh and
well pleased with themselves. He had a word with one and another before
he sat down at the little table by a window, where the Austrian head
waiter stood attentively behind a chair. After his breakfast was put
before him, the doctor began to run over his letters. There was one
directed in Thea Kronborg's handwriting, forwarded from Moonstone. He
saw with astonishment, as he put another lump of sugar into his cup,
that this letter bore a New York postmark. He had known that Thea was in
Mexico, traveling with some Chicago people, but New York, to a Denver
man, seems much farther away than Mexico City. He put the letter behind
his plate, upright against the stem of his water goblet, and looked at
it thoughtfully while he drank his second cup of coffee. He had been a
little anxious about Thea; she had not written to him for a long while.

As he never got good coffee at home, the doctor always drank three cups
for breakfast when he was in Denver. Oscar knew just when to bring him a
second pot, fresh and smoking. "And more cream, Oscar, please. You know
I like lots of cream," the doctor murmured, as he opened the square
envelope, marked in the upper right-hand corner, "Everett House, Union
Square." The text of the letter was as follows:--

DEAR DOCTOR ARCHIE:--

I have not written to you for a long time, but it has not been
unintentional. I could not write you frankly, and so I would not write
at all. I can be frank with you now, but not by letter. It is a great
deal to ask, but I wonder if you could come to New York to help me out?
I have got into difficulties, and I need your advice. I need your
friendship. I am afraid I must even ask you to lend me money, if you can
without serious inconvenience. I have to go to Germany to study, and it
can't be put off any longer. My voice is ready. Needless to say, I don't
want any word of this to reach my family. They are the last people I
would turn to, though I love my mother dearly. If you can come, please
telegraph me at this hotel. Don't despair of me. I'll make it up to you
yet.

Your old friend,

THEA KRONBORG.


This in a bold, jagged handwriting with a Gothic turn to the
letters,--something between a highly sophisticated hand and a very
unsophisticated one,--not in the least smooth or flowing.

The doctor bit off the end of a cigar nervously and read the letter
through again, fumbling distractedly in his pockets for matches, while
the waiter kept trying to call his attention to the box he had just
placed before him. At last Oscar came out, as if the idea had just
struck him, "Matches, sir?"

"Yes, thank you." The doctor slipped a coin into his palm and rose,
crumpling Thea's letter in his hand and thrusting the others into his
pocket unopened. He went back to the desk in the lobby and beckoned to
the clerk, upon whose kindness he threw himself apologetically.

"Harry, I've got to pull out unexpectedly. Call up the Burlington, will
you, and ask them to route me to New York the quickest way, and to let
us know. Ask for the hour I'll get in. I have to wire."

"Certainly, Dr. Archie. Have it for you in a minute." The young man's
pallid, clean-scraped face was all sympathetic interest as he reached
for the telephone. Dr. Archie put out his hand and stopped him.

"Wait a minute. Tell me, first, is Captain Harris down yet?"

"No, sir. The Captain hasn't come down yet this morning."

"I'll wait here for him. If I don't happen to catch him, nail him and
get me. Thank you, Harry."

The doctor spoke gratefully and turned away. He began to pace the lobby,
his hands behind him, watching the bronze elevator doors like a hawk. At
last Captain Harris issued from one of them, tall and imposing, wearing
a Stetson and fierce mustaches, a fur coat on his arm, a solitaire
glittering upon his little finger and another in his black satin ascot.
He was one of the grand old bluffers of those good old days. As gullible
as a schoolboy, he had managed, with his sharp eye and knowing air and
twisted blond mustaches, to pass himself off for an astute financier,
and the Denver papers respectfully referred to him as the Rothschild of
Cripple Creek.

Dr. Archie stopped the Captain on his way to breakfast. "Must see you a
minute, Captain. Can't wait. Want to sell you some shares in the San
Felipe. Got to raise money."

The Captain grandly bestowed his hat upon an eager porter who had
already lifted his fur coat tenderly from his arm and stood nursing it.
In removing his hat, the Captain exposed a bald, flushed dome, thatched
about the ears with yellowish gray hair. "Bad time to sell, doctor. You
want to hold on to San Felipe, and buy more. What have you got to
raise?"

"Oh, not a great sum. Five or six thousand. I've been buying up close
and have run short."

"I see, I see. Well, doctor, you'll have to let me get through that
door. I was out last night, and I'm going to get my bacon, if you lose
your mine." He clapped Archie on the shoulder and pushed him along in
front of him. "Come ahead with me, and we'll talk business."

Dr. Archie attended the Captain and waited while he gave his order,
taking the seat the old promoter indicated.

"Now, sir," the Captain turned to him, "you don't want to sell anything.
You must be under the impression that I'm one of these damned New
England sharks that get their pound of flesh off the widow and orphan.
If you're a little short, sign a note and I'll write a check. That's the
way gentlemen do business. If you want to put up some San Felipe as
collateral, let her go, but I shan't touch a share of it. Pens and ink,
please, Oscar,"--he lifted a large forefinger to the Austrian.

The Captain took out his checkbook and a book of blank notes, and
adjusted his nose-nippers. He wrote a few words in one book and Archie
wrote a few in the other. Then they each tore across perforations and
exchanged slips of paper.

"That's the way. Saves office rent," the Captain commented with
satisfaction, returning the books to his pocket. "And now, Archie, where
are you off to?"

"Got to go East to-night. A deal waiting for me in New York." Dr. Archie
rose.

The Captain's face brightened as he saw Oscar approaching with a tray,
and he began tucking the corner of his napkin inside his collar, over
his ascot. "Don't let them unload anything on you back there, doctor,"
he said genially, "and don't let them relieve you of anything, either.
Don't let them get any Cripple stuff off you. We can manage our own
silver out here, and we're going to take it out by the ton, sir!"

The doctor left the dining-room, and after another consultation with the
clerk, he wrote his first telegram to Thea:--


Miss Thea Kronborg,
Everett House, New York.

Will call at your hotel eleven o'clock Friday morning. Glad to come.
Thank you.

ARCHIE


He stood and heard the message actually clicked off on the wire, with
the feeling that she was hearing the click at the other end. Then he sat
down in the lobby and wrote a note to his wife and one to the other
doctor in Moonstone. When he at last issued out into the storm, it was
with a feeling of elation rather than of anxiety. Whatever was wrong, he
could make it right. Her letter had practically said so.

He tramped about the snowy streets, from the bank to the Union Station,
where he shoved his money under the grating of the ticket window as if
he could not get rid of it fast enough. He had never been in New York,
never been farther east than Buffalo. "That's rather a shame," he
reflected boyishly as he put the long tickets in his pocket, "for a man
nearly forty years old." However, he thought as he walked up toward the
club, he was on the whole glad that his first trip had a human interest,
that he was going for something, and because he was wanted. He loved
holidays. He felt as if he were going to Germany himself. "Queer,"--he
went over it with the snow blowing in his face,--"but that sort of thing
is more interesting than mines and making your daily bread. It's worth
paying out to be in on it,--for a fellow like me. And when it's
Thea--Oh, I back her!" he laughed aloud as he burst in at the door of
the Athletic Club, powdered with snow.

Archie sat down before the New York papers and ran over the
advertisements of hotels, but he was too restless to read. Probably he
had better get a new overcoat, and he was not sure about the shape of
his collars. "I don't want to look different to her from everybody else
there," he mused. "I guess I'll go down and have Van look me over. He'll
put me right."

So he plunged out into the snow again and started for his tailor's. When
he passed a florist's shop he stopped and looked in at the window,
smiling; how naturally pleasant things recalled one another. At the
tailor's he kept whistling, "Flow gently, Sweet Afton," while Van Dusen
advised him, until that resourceful tailor and haberdasher exclaimed,
"You must have a date back there, doctor; you behave like a bridegroom,"
and made him remember that he wasn't one.

Before he let him go, Van put his finger on the Masonic pin in his
client's lapel. "Mustn't wear that, doctor. Very bad form back there."




II

FRED OTTENBURG, smartly dressed for the afternoon, with a long black
coat and gaiters was sitting in the dusty parlor of the Everett House.
His manner was not in accord with his personal freshness, the good lines
of his clothes, and the shining smoothness of his hair. His attitude was
one of deep dejection, and his face, though it had the cool,
unimpeachable fairness possible only to a very blond young man, was by
no means happy. A page shuffled into the room and looked about. When he
made out the dark figure in a shadowy corner, tracing over the carpet
pattern with a cane, he droned, "The lady says you can come up, sir."

Fred picked up his hat and gloves and followed the creature, who seemed
an aged boy in uniform, through dark corridors that smelled of old
carpets. The page knocked at the door of Thea's sitting-room, and then
wandered away. Thea came to the door with a telegram in her hand. She
asked Ottenburg to come in and pointed to one of the clumsy,
sullen-looking chairs that were as thick as they were high. The room was
brown with time, dark in spite of two windows that opened on Union
Square, with dull curtains and carpet, and heavy, respectable-looking
furniture in somber colors. The place was saved from utter dismalness by
a coal fire under the black marble mantelpiece,--brilliantly reflected
in a long mirror that hung between the two windows. This was the first
time Fred had seen the room, and he took it in quickly, as he put down
his hat and gloves.

Thea seated herself at the walnut writing-desk, still holding the slip
of yellow paper. "Dr. Archie is coming," she said. "He will be here
Friday morning."

"Well, that's good, at any rate," her visitor replied with a determined
effort at cheerfulness. Then, turning to the fire, he added blankly, "If
you want him."

"Of course I want him. I would never have asked such a thing of him if I
hadn't wanted him a great deal. It's a very expensive trip." Thea spoke
severely. Then she went on, in a milder tone. "He doesn't say anything
about the money, but I think his coming means that he can let me have
it."

Fred was standing before the mantel, rubbing his hands together
nervously. "Probably. You are still determined to call on him?" He sat
down tentatively in the chair Thea had indicated. "I don't see why you
won't borrow from me, and let him sign with you, for instance. That
would constitute a perfectly regular business transaction. I could bring
suit against either of you for my money."

Thea turned toward him from the desk. "We won't take that up again,
Fred. I should have a different feeling about it if I went on your
money. In a way I shall feel freer on Dr. Archie's, and in another way I
shall feel more bound. I shall try even harder." She paused. "He is
almost like my father," she added irrelevantly.

"Still, he isn't, you know," Fred persisted. "It wouldn't be anything
new. I've loaned money to students before, and got it back, too."

"Yes; I know you're generous," Thea hurried over it, "but this will be
the best way. He will be here on Friday did I tell you?"

"I think you mentioned it. That's rather soon. May I smoke?" he took out
a small cigarette case. "I suppose you'll be off next week?" he asked as
he struck a match.

"Just as soon as I can," she replied with a restless movement of her
arms, as if her dark-blue dress were too tight for her. "It seems as if
I'd been here forever."

"And yet," the young man mused, "we got in only four days ago. Facts
really don't count for much, do they? It's all in the way people feel:
even in little things."

Thea winced, but she did not answer him. She put the telegram back in
its envelope and placed it carefully in one of the pigeonholes of the
desk.

"I suppose," Fred brought out with effort, "that your friend is in your
confidence?"

"He always has been. I shall have to tell him about myself. I wish I
could without dragging you in."

Fred shook himself. "Don't bother about where you drag me, please," he
put in, flushing. "I don't give--" he subsided suddenly.

"I'm afraid," Thea went on gravely, "that he won't understand. He'll be
hard on you."

Fred studied the white ash of his cigarette before he flicked it off.
"You mean he'll see me as even worse than I am. Yes, I suppose I shall
look very low to him: a fifthrate scoundrel. But that only matters in so
far as it hurts his feelings."

Thea sighed. "We'll both look pretty low. And after all, we must really
be just about as we shall look to him."

Ottenburg started up and threw his cigarette into the grate. "That I
deny. Have you ever been really frank with this preceptor of your
childhood, even when you WERE a child? Think a minute, have you? Of
course not! From your cradle, as I once told you, you've been 'doing it'
on the side, living your own life, admitting to yourself things that
would horrify him. You've always deceived him to the extent of letting
him think you different from what you are. He couldn't understand then,
he can't understand now. So why not spare yourself and him?"

She shook her head. "Of course, I've had my own thoughts. Maybe he has
had his, too. But I've never done anything before that he would much
mind. I must put myself right with him,--as right as I can,--to begin
over. He'll make allowances for me. He always has. But I'm afraid he
won't for you."

"Leave that to him and me. I take it you want me to see him?" Fred sat
down again and began absently to trace the carpet pattern with his cane.
"At the worst," he spoke wanderingly, "I thought you'd perhaps let me go
in on the business end of it and invest along with you. You'd put in
your talent and ambition and hard work, and I'd put in the money
and--well, nobody's good wishes are to be scorned, not even mine. Then,
when the thing panned out big, we could share together. Your doctor
friend hasn't cared half so much about your future as I have."

"He's cared a good deal. He doesn't know as much about such things as
you do. Of course you've been a great deal more help to me than any one
else ever has," Thea said quietly. The black clock on the mantel began
to strike. She listened to the five strokes and then said, "I'd have
liked your helping me eight months ago. But now, you'd simply be keeping
me."

"You weren't ready for it eight months ago." Fred leaned back at last in
his chair. "You simply weren't ready for it. You were too tired. You
were too timid. Your whole tone was too low. You couldn't rise from a
chair like that,"--she had started up apprehensively and gone toward the
window.--"You were fumbling and awkward. Since then you've come into
your personality. You were always locking horns with it before. You were
a sullen little drudge eight months ago, afraid of being caught at
either looking or moving like yourself. Nobody could tell anything about
you. A voice is not an instrument that's found ready-made. A voice is
personality. It can be as big as a circus and as common as
dirt.--There's good money in that kind, too, but I don't happen to be
interested in them.--Nobody could tell much about what you might be able
to do, last winter. I divined more than anybody else."

"Yes, I know you did." Thea walked over to the oldfashioned mantel and
held her hands down to the glow of the fire. "I owe so much to you, and
that's what makes things hard. That's why I have to get away from you
altogether. I depend on you for so many things. Oh, I did even last
winter, in Chicago!" She knelt down by the grate and held her hands
closer to the coals. "And one thing leads to another."

Ottenburg watched her as she bent toward the fire. His glance brightened
a little. "Anyhow, you couldn't look as you do now, before you knew me.
You WERE clumsy. And whatever you do now, you do splendidly. And you
can't cry enough to spoil your face for more than ten minutes. It comes
right back, in spite of you. It's only since you've known me that you've
let yourself be beautiful."

Without rising she turned her face away. Fred went on impetuously. "Oh,
you can turn it away from me, Thea; you can take it away from me! All
the same--" his spurt died and he fell back. "How can you turn on me so,
after all!" he sighed.

"I haven't. But when you arranged with yourself to take me in like that,
you couldn't have been thinking very kindly of me. I can't understand
how you carried it through, when I was so easy, and all the
circumstances were so easy."

Her crouching position by the fire became threatening. Fred got up, and
Thea also rose.

"No," he said, "I can't make you see that now. Some time later, perhaps,
you will understand better. For one thing, I honestly could not imagine
that words, names, meant so much to you." Fred was talking with the
desperation of a man who has put himself in the wrong and who yet feels
that there was an idea of truth in his conduct. "Suppose that you had
married your brakeman and lived with him year after year, caring for him
even less than you do for your doctor, or for Harsanyi. I suppose you
would have felt quite all right about it, because that relation has a
name in good standing. To me, that seems--sickening!" He took a rapid
turn about the room and then as Thea remained standing, he rolled one of
the elephantine chairs up to the hearth for her.

"Sit down and listen to me for a moment, Thea." He began pacing from the
hearthrug to the window and back again, while she sat down compliantly.
"Don't you know most of the people in the world are not individuals at
all? They never have an individual idea or experience. A lot of girls go
to boarding-school together, come out the same season, dance at the same
parties, are married off in groups, have their babies at about the same
time, send their children to school together, and so the human crop
renews itself. Such women know as much about the reality of the forms
they go through as they know about the wars they learn the dates of.
They get their most personal experiences out of novels and plays.
Everything is second-hand with them. Why, you COULDN'T live like that."

Thea sat looking toward the mantel, her eyes half closed, her chin
level, her head set as if she were enduring something. Her hands, very
white, lay passive on her dark gown. From the window corner Fred looked
at them and at her. He shook his head and flashed an angry, tormented
look out into the blue twilight over the Square, through which muffled
cries and calls and the clang of car bells came up from the street. He
turned again and began to pace the floor, his hands in his pockets.

"Say what you will, Thea Kronborg, you are not that sort of person. You
will never sit alone with a pacifier and a novel. You won't subsist on
what the old ladies have put into the bottle for you. You will always
break through into the realities. That was the first thing Harsanyi
found out about you; that you couldn't be kept on the outside. If you'd
lived in Moonstone all your life and got on with the discreet brakeman,
you'd have had just the same nature. Your children would have been the
realities then, probably. If they'd been commonplace, you'd have killed
them with driving. You'd have managed some way to live twenty times as
much as the people around you."

Fred paused. He sought along the shadowy ceiling and heavy mouldings for
words. When he began again, his voice was lower, and at first he spoke
with less conviction, though again it grew on him. "Now I knew all
this--oh, knew it better than I can ever make you understand! You've
been running a handicap. You had no time to lose. I wanted you to have
what you need and to get on fast--get through with me, if need be; I
counted on that. You've no time to sit round and analyze your conduct or
your feelings. Other women give their whole lives to it. They've nothing
else to do. Helping a man to get his divorce is a career for them; just
the sort of intellectual exercise they like."

Fred dived fiercely into his pockets as if he would rip them out and
scatter their contents to the winds. Stopping before her, he took a deep
breath and went on again, this time slowly. "All that sort of thing is
foreign to you. You'd be nowhere at it. You haven't that kind of mind.
The grammatical niceties of conduct are dark to you. You're simple--and
poetic." Fred's voice seemed to be wandering about in the thickening
dusk. "You won't play much. You won't, perhaps, love many times." He
paused. "And you did love me, you know. Your railroad friend would have
understood me. I COULD have thrown you back. The reverse was there,--it
stared me in the face,--but I couldn't pull it. I let you drive ahead."
He threw out his hands. What Thea noticed, oddly enough, was the flash
of the firelight on his cuff link. He turned again. "And you'll always
drive ahead," he muttered. "It's your way."

There was a long silence. Fred had dropped into a chair. He seemed,
after such an explosion, not to ave a word left in him. Thea put her
hand to the back of her neck and pressed it, as if the muscles there
were aching.

"Well," she said at last, "I at least overlook more in you than I do in
myself. I am always excusing you to myself. I don't do much else."

"Then why, in Heaven's name, won't you let me be your friend? You make a
scoundrel of me, borrowing money from another man to get out of my
clutches."

"If I borrow from him, it's to study. Anything I took from you would be
different. As I said before, you'd be keeping me."

"Keeping! I like your language. It's pure Moonstone, Thea,--like your
point of view. I wonder how long you'll be a Methodist." He turned away
bitterly.

"Well, I've never said I wasn't Moonstone, have I? I am, and that's why
I want Dr. Archie. I can't see anything so funny about Moonstone, you
know." She pushed her chair back a little from the hearth and clasped
her hands over her knee, still looking thoughtfully into the red coals.
"We always come back to the same thing, Fred. The name, as you call it,
makes a difference to me how I feel about myself. You would have acted
very differently with a girl of your own kind, and that's why I can't
take anything from you now. You've made everything impossible. Being
married is one thing and not being married is the other thing, and
that's all there is to it. I can't see how you reasoned with yourself,
if you took the trouble to reason. You say I was too much alone, and yet
what you did was to cut me off more than I ever had been. Now I'm going
to try to make good to my friends out there. That's all there is left
for me."

"Make good to your friends!" Fred burst out. "What one of them cares as
I care, or believes as I believe? I've told you I'll never ask a
gracious word from you until I can ask it with all the churches in
Christendom at my back."

Thea looked up, and when she saw Fred's face, she thought sadly that he,
too, looked as if things were spoiled for him. "If you know me as well
as you say you do, Fred," she said slowly, "then you are not being
honest with yourself. You know that I can't do things halfway. If you
kept me at all--you'd keep me." She dropped her head wearily on her hand
and sat with her forehead resting on her fingers.

Fred leaned over her and said just above his breath, "Then, when I get
that divorce, you'll take it up with me again? You'll at least let me
know, warn me, before there is a serious question of anybody else?"

Without lifting her head, Thea answered him. "Oh, I don't think there
will ever be a question of anybody else. Not if I can help it. I suppose
I've given you every reason to think there will be,--at once, on
shipboard, any time."

Ottenburg drew himself up like a shot. "Stop it, Thea!" he said sharply.
"That's one thing you've never done. That's like any common woman." He
saw her shoulders lift a little and grow calm. Then he went to the other
side of the room and took up his hat and gloves from the sofa. He came
back cheerfully. "I didn't drop in to bully you this afternoon. I came
to coax you to go out for tea with me somewhere." He waited, but she did
not look up or lift her head, still sunk on her hand.

Her handkerchief had fallen. Fred picked it up and put it on her knee,
pressing her fingers over it. "Good-night, dear and wonderful," he
whispered,--"wonderful and dear! How can you ever get away from me when
I will always follow you, through every wall, through every door,
wherever you go." He looked down at her bent head, and the curve of her
neck that was so sad. He stooped, and with his lips just touched her
hair where the firelight made it ruddiest. "I didn't know I had it in
me, Thea. I thought it was all a fairy tale. I don't know myself any
more." He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. "The salt's all gone out
of your hair. It's full of sun and wind again. I believe it has
memories." Again she heard him take a deep breath. "I could do without
you for a lifetime, if that would give you to yourself. A woman like you
doesn't find herself, alone."

She thrust her free hand up to him. He kissed it softly, as if she were
asleep and he were afraid of waking her.

From the door he turned back irrelevantly. "As to your old friend, Thea,
if he's to be here on Friday, why,"--he snatched out his watch and held
it down to catch the light from the grate,--"he's on the train now! That
ought to cheer you. Good-night." She heard the door close.




III

ON Friday afternoon Thea Kronborg was walking excitedly up and down her
sitting-room, which at that hour was flooded by thin, clear sunshine.
Both windows were open, and the fire in the grate was low, for the day
was one of those false springs that sometimes blow into New York from
the sea in the middle of winter, soft, warm, with a persuasive salty
moisture in the air and a relaxing thaw under foot. Thea was flushed and
animated, and she seemed as restless as the sooty sparrows that chirped
and cheeped distractingly about the windows. She kept looking at the
black clock, and then down into the Square. The room was full of
flowers, and she stopped now and then to arrange them or to move them
into the sunlight. After the bellboy came to announce a visitor, she
took some Roman hyacinths from a glass and stuck them in the front of
her dark-blue dress.

When at last Fred Ottenburg appeared in the doorway, she met him with an
exclamation of pleasure. "I am glad you've come, Fred. I was afraid you
might not get my note, and I wanted to see you before you see Dr.
Archie. He's so nice!" She brought her hands together to emphasize her
statement.

"Is he? I'm glad. You see I'm quite out of breath. I didn't wait for the
elevator, but ran upstairs. I was so pleased at being sent for." He
dropped his hat and overcoat. "Yes, I should say he is nice! I don't
seem to recognize all of these," waving his handkerchief about at the
flowers.

"Yes, he brought them himself, in a big box. He brought lots with him
besides flowers. Oh, lots of things! The old Moonstone feeling,"--Thea
moved her hand back and forth in the air, fluttering her fingers,--"the
feeling of starting out, early in the morning, to take my lesson."

"And you've had everything out with him?"

"No, I haven't."

"Haven't?" He looked up in consternation.

"No, I haven't!" Thea spoke excitedly, moving about over the sunny
patches on the grimy carpet. "I've lied to him, just as you said I had
always lied to him, and that's why I'm so happy. I've let him think what
he likes to think. Oh, I couldn't do anything else, Fred,"--she shook
her head emphatically. "If you'd seen him when he came in, so pleased
and excited! You see this is a great adventure for him. From the moment
I began to talk to him, he entreated me not to say too much, not to
spoil his notion of me. Not in so many words, of course. But if you'd
seen his eyes, his face, his kind hands! Oh, no! I couldn't." She took a
deep breath, as if with a renewed sense of her narrow escape.

"Then, what did you tell him?" Fred demanded.

Thea sat down on the edge of the sofa and began shutting and opening her
hands nervously. "Well, I told him enough, and not too much. I told him
all about how good you were to me last winter, getting me engagements
and things, and how you had helped me with my work more than anybody.
Then I told him about how you sent me down to the ranch when I had no
money or anything." She paused and wrinkled her forehead. "And I told
him that I wanted to marry you and ran away to Mexico with you, and that
I was awfully happy until you told me that you couldn't marry me
because--well, I told him why." Thea dropped her eyes and moved the toe
of her shoe about restlessly on the carpet.

"And he took it from you, like that?" Fred asked, almost with awe.

"Yes, just like that, and asked no questions. He was hurt; he had some
wretched moments. I could see him squirming and squirming and trying to
get past it. He kept shutting his eyes and rubbing his forehead. But
when I told him that I absolutely knew you wanted to marry me, that you
would whenever you could, that seemed to help him a good deal."

"And that satisfied him?" Fred asked wonderingly. He could not quite
imagine what kind of person Dr. Archie might be.

"He took me by the shoulders once and asked, oh, in such a frightened
way, 'Thea, was he GOOD to you, this young man?' When I told him you
were, he looked at me again: 'And you care for him a great deal, you
believe in him?' Then he seemed satisfied." Thea paused. "You see, he's
just tremendously good, and tremendously afraid of things--of some
things. Otherwise he would have got rid of Mrs. Archie." She looked up
suddenly: "You were right, though; one can't tell people about things
they don't know already."

Fred stood in the window, his back to the sunlight, fingering the
jonquils. "Yes, you can, my dear. But you must tell it in such a way
that they don't know you're telling it, and that they don't know they're
hearing it."

Thea smiled past him, out into the air. "I see. It's a secret. Like the
sound in the shell."

"What's that?" Fred was watching her and thinking how moving that
faraway expression, in her, happened to be. "What did you say?"

She came back. "Oh, something old and Moonstony! I have almost forgotten
it myself. But I feel better than I thought I ever could again. I can't
wait to be off. Oh, Fred," she sprang up, "I want to get at it!"

As she broke out with this, she threw up her head and lifted herself a
little on her toes. Fred colored and looked at her fearfully,
hesitatingly. Her eyes, which looked out through the window, were
bright--they had no memories. No, she did not remember. That momentary
elevation had no associations for her. It was unconscious.

He looked her up and down and laughed and shook his head. "You are just
all I want you to be--and that is,--not for me! Don't worry, you'll get
at it. You are at it. My God! have you ever, for one moment, been at
anything else?"

Thea did not answer him, and clearly she had not heard him. She was
watching something out in the thin light of the false spring and its
treacherously soft air.

Fred waited a moment. "Are you going to dine with your friend to-night?"

"Yes. He has never been in New York before. He wants to go about. Where
shall I tell him to go?"

"Wouldn't it be a better plan, since you wish me to meet him, for you
both to dine with me? It would seem only natural and friendly. You'll
have to live up a little to his notion of us." Thea seemed to consider
the suggestion favorably. "If you wish him to be easy in his mind," Fred
went on, "that would help. I think, myself, that we are rather nice
together. Put on one of the new dresses you got down there, and let him
see how lovely you can be. You owe him some pleasure, after all the
trouble he has taken."

Thea laughed, and seemed to find the idea exciting and pleasant. "Oh,
very well! I'll do my best. Only don't wear a dress coat, please. He
hasn't one, and he's nervous about it."

Fred looked at his watch. "Your monument up there is fast. I'll be here
with a cab at eight. I'm anxious to meet him. You've given me the
strangest idea of his callow innocence and aged indifference."

She shook her head. "No, he's none of that. He's very good, and he won't
admit things. I love him for it. Now, as I look back on it, I see that
I've always, even when I was little, shielded him."

As she laughed, Fred caught the bright spark in her eye that he knew so
well, and held it for a happy instant. Then he blew her a kiss with his
finger-tips and fled.




IV

AT nine o'clock that evening our three friends were seated in the
balcony of a French restaurant, much gayer and more intimate than any
that exists in New York to-day. This old restaurant was built by a lover
of pleasure, who knew that to dine gayly human beings must have the
reassurance of certain limitations of space and of a certain definite
style; that the walls must be near enough to suggest shelter, the
ceiling high enough to give the chandeliers a setting. The place was
crowded with the kind of people who dine late and well, and Dr. Archie,
as he watched the animated groups in the long room below the balcony,
found this much the most festive scene he had ever looked out upon. He
said to himself, in a jovial mood somewhat sustained by the cheer of the
board, that this evening alone was worth his long journey. He followed
attentively the orchestra, ensconced at the farther end of the balcony,
and told Thea it made him feel "quite musical" to recognize "The
Invitation to the Dance" or "The Blue Danube," and that he could
remember just what kind of day it was when he heard her practicing them
at home, and lingered at the gate to listen.

For the first few moments, when he was introduced to young Ottenburg in
the parlor of the Everett House, the doctor had been awkward and
unbending. But Fred, as his father had often observed, "was not a good
mixer for nothing." He had brought Dr. Archie around during the short
cab ride, and in an hour they had become old friends.

From the moment when the doctor lifted his glass and, looking
consciously at Thea, said, "To your success," Fred liked him. He felt
his quality; understood his courage in some directions and what Thea
called his timidity in others, his unspent and miraculously preserved
youthfulness. Men could never impose upon the doctor, he guessed, but
women always could. Fred liked, too, the doctor's manner with Thea, his
bashful admiration and the little hesitancy by which he betrayed his
consciousness of the change in her. It was just this change that, at
present, interested Fred more than anything else. That, he felt, was his
"created value," and it was his best chance for any peace of mind. If
that were not real, obvious to an old friend like Archie, then he cut a
very poor figure, indeed.

Fred got a good deal, too, out of their talk about Moonstone. From her
questions and the doctor's answers he was able to form some conception
of the little world that was almost the measure of Thea's experience,
the one bit of the human drama that she had followed with sympathy and
understanding. As the two ran over the list of their friends, the mere
sound of a name seemed to recall volumes to each of them, to indicate
mines of knowledge and observation they had in common. At some names
they laughed delightedly, at some indulgently and even tenderly.

"You two young people must come out to Moonstone when Thea gets back,"
the doctor said hospitably.

"Oh, we shall!" Fred caught it up. "I'm keen to know all these people.
It is very tantalizing to hear only their names."

"Would they interest an outsider very much, do you think, Dr. Archie?"
Thea leaned toward him. "Isn't it only because we've known them since I
was little?"

The doctor glanced at her deferentially. Fred had noticed that he seemed
a little afraid to look at her squarely--perhaps a trifle embarrassed by
a mode of dress to which he was unaccustomed. "Well, you are practically
an outsider yourself, Thea, now," he observed smiling. "Oh, I know," he
went on quickly in response to her gesture of protest,--"I know you
don't change toward your old friends, but you can see us all from a
distance now. It's all to your advantage that you can still take your
old interest, isn't it, Mr. Ottenburg?"

"That's exactly one of her advantages, Dr. Archie. Nobody can ever take
that away from her, and none of us who came later can ever hope to rival
Moonstone in the impression we make. Her scale of values will always be
the Moonstone scale. And, with an artist, that IS an advantage." Fred
nodded.

Dr. Archie looked at him seriously. "You mean it keeps them from getting
affected?"

"Yes; keeps them from getting off the track generally."

While the waiter filled the glasses, Fred pointed out to Thea a big
black French barytone who was eating anchovies by their tails at one of
the tables below, and the doctor looked about and studied his fellow
diners.

"Do you know, Mr. Ottenburg," he said deeply, "these people all look
happier to me than our Western people do. Is it simply good manners on
their part, or do they get more out of life?"

Fred laughed to Thea above the glass he had just lifted. "Some of them
are getting a good deal out of it now, doctor. This is the hour when
bench-joy brightens."

Thea chuckled and darted him a quick glance. "Benchjoy! Where did you
get that slang?"

"That happens to be very old slang, my dear. Older than Moonstone or the
sovereign State of Colorado. Our old friend Mr. Nathanmeyer could tell
us why it happens to hit you." He leaned forward and touched Thea's
wrist, "See that fur coat just coming in, Thea. It's D'Albert. He's just
back from his Western tour. Fine head, hasn't he?"

"To go back," said Dr. Archie; "I insist that people do look happier
here. I've noticed it even on the street, and especially in the hotels."

Fred turned to him cheerfully. "New York people live a good deal in the
fourth dimension, Dr. Archie. It's that you notice in their faces."

The doctor was interested. "The fourth dimension," he repeated slowly;
"and is that slang, too?"

"No,"--Fred shook his head,--"that's merely a figure. I mean that life
is not quite so personal here as it is in your part of the world. People
are more taken up by hobbies, interests that are less subject to
reverses than their personal affairs. If you're interested in Thea's
voice, for instance, or in voices in general, that interest is just the
same, even if your mining stocks go down."

The doctor looked at him narrowly. "You think that's about the principal
difference between country people and city people, don't you?"

Fred was a little disconcerted at being followed up so resolutely, and
he attempted to dismiss it with a pleasantry. "I've never thought much
about it, doctor. But I should say, on the spur of the moment, that that
is one of the principal differences between people anywhere. It's the
consolation of fellows like me who don't accomplish much. The fourth
dimension is not good for business, but we think we have a better time."

Dr. Archie leaned back in his chair. His heavy shoulders were
contemplative. "And she," he said slowly; "should you say that she is
one of the kind you refer to?" He inclined his head toward the shimmer
of the pale-green dress beside him. Thea was leaning, just then, over
the balcony rail, her head in the light from the chandeliers below.

"Never, never!" Fred protested. "She's as hard-headed as the worst of
you--with a difference."

The doctor sighed. "Yes, with a difference; something that makes a good
many revolutions to the second. When she was little I used to feel her
head to try to locate it."

Fred laughed. "Did you, though? So you were on the track of it? Oh, it's
there! We can't get round it, miss," as Thea looked back inquiringly.
"Dr. Archie, there's a fellow townsman of yours I feel a real kinship
for." He pressed a cigar upon Dr. Archie and struck a match for him.
"Tell me about Spanish Johnny."

The doctor smiled benignantly through the first waves of smoke. "Well,
Johnny's an old patient of mine, and he's an old admirer of Thea's. She
was born a cosmopolitan, and I expect she learned a good deal from
Johnny when she used to run away and go to Mexican Town. We thought it a
queer freak then."

The doctor launched into a long story, in which he was often eagerly
interrupted or joyously confirmed by Thea, who was drinking her coffee
and forcing open the petals of the roses with an ardent and rather rude
hand. Fred settled down into enjoying his comprehension of his guests.
Thea, watching Dr. Archie and interested in his presentation, was
unconsciously impersonating her suave, gold-tinted friend. It was
delightful to see her so radiant and responsive again. She had kept her
promise about looking her best; when one could so easily get together
the colors of an apple branch in early spring, that was not hard to do.
Even Dr. Archie felt, each time he looked at her, a fresh consciousness.
He recognized the fine texture of her mother's skin, with the difference
that, when she reached across the table to give him a bunch of grapes,
her arm was not only white, but somehow a little dazzling. She seemed to
him taller, and freer in all her movements. She had now a way of taking
a deep breath when she was interested, that made her seem very strong,
somehow, and brought her at one quite overpoweringly. If he seemed shy,
it was not that he was intimidated by her worldly clothes, but that her
greater positiveness, her whole augmented self, made him feel that his
accustomed manner toward her was inadequate.

Fred, on his part, was reflecting that the awkward position in which he
had placed her would not confine or chafe her long. She looked about at
other people, at other women, curiously. She was not quite sure of
herself, but she was not in the least afraid or apologetic. She seemed
to sit there on the edge, emerging from one world into another, taking
her bearings, getting an idea of the concerted movement about her, but
with absolute self-confidence. So far from shrinking, she expanded. The
mere kindly effort to please Dr. Archie was enough to bring her out.

There was much talk of aurae at that time, and Fred mused that every
beautiful, every compellingly beautiful woman, had an aura, whether
other people did or no. There was, certainly, about the woman he had
brought up from Mexico, such an emanation. She existed in more space
than she occupied by measurement. The enveloping air about her head and
shoulders was subsidized--was more moving than she herself, for in it
lived the awakenings, all the first sweetness that life kills in people.
One felt in her such a wealth of JUGENDZEIT, all those flowers of the
mind and the blood that bloom and perish by the myriad in the few
exhaustless years when the imagination first kindles. It was in watching
her as she emerged like this, in being near and not too near, that one
got, for a moment, so much that one had lost; among other legendary
things the legendary theme of the absolutely magical power of a
beautiful woman.

After they had left Thea at her hotel, Dr. Archie admitted to Fred, as
they walked up Broadway through the rapidly chilling air, that once
before he had seen their young friend flash up into a more potent self,
but in a darker mood. It was in his office one night, when she was at
home the summer before last. "And then I got the idea," he added simply,
"that she would not live like other people: that, for better or worse,
she had uncommon gifts."

"Oh, we'll see that it's for better, you and I," Fred reassured him.
"Won't you come up to my hotel with me? I think we ought to have a long
talk."

"Yes, indeed," said Dr. Archie gratefully; "I think we ought."




V

THEA was to sail on Tuesday, at noon, and on Saturday Fred Ottenburg
arranged for her passage, while she and Dr. Archie went shopping. With
rugs and sea-clothes she was already provided; Fred had got everything
of that sort she needed for the voyage up from Vera Cruz. On Sunday
afternoon Thea went to see the Harsanyis. When she returned to her
hotel, she found a note from Ottenburg, saying that he had called and
would come again to-morrow.

On Monday morning, while she was at breakfast, Fred came in. She knew by
his hurried, distracted air as he entered the dining-room that something
had gone wrong. He had just got a telegram from home. His mother had
been thrown from her carriage and hurt; a concussion of some sort, and
she was unconscious. He was leaving for St. Louis that night on the
eleven o'clock train. He had a great deal to attend to during the day.
He would come that evening, if he might, and stay with her until train
time, while she was doing her packing. Scarcely waiting for her consent,
he hurried away.

All day Thea was somewhat cast down. She was sorry for Fred, and she
missed the feeling that she was the one person in his mind. He had
scarcely looked at her when they exchanged words at the breakfast-table.
She felt as if she were set aside, and she did not seem so important
even to herself as she had yesterday. Certainly, she reflected, it was
high time that she began to take care of herself again. Dr. Archie came
for dinner, but she sent him away early, telling him that she would be
ready to go to the boat with him at half-past ten the next morning. When
she went upstairs, she looked gloomily at the open trunk in her
sitting-room, and at the trays piled on the sofa. She stood at the
window and watched a quiet snowstorm spending itself over the city. More
than anything else, falling snow always made her think of Moonstone; of
the Kohlers' garden, of Thor's sled, of dressing by lamplight and
starting off to school before the paths were broken.

When Fred came, he looked tired, and he took her hand almost without
seeing her.

"I'm so sorry, Fred. Have you had any more word?"

"She was still unconscious at four this afternoon. It doesn't look very
encouraging." He approached the fire and warmed his hands. He seemed to
have contracted, and he had not at all his habitual ease of manner.
"Poor mother!" he exclaimed; "nothing like this should have happened to
her. She has so much pride of person. She's not at all an old woman, you
know. She's never got beyond vigorous and rather dashing middle age." He
turned abruptly to Thea and for the first time really looked at her.
"How badly things come out! She'd have liked you for a daughter-in-law.
Oh, you'd have fought like the devil, but you'd have respected each
other." He sank into a chair and thrust his feet out to the fire.
"Still," he went on thoughtfully, seeming to address the ceiling, "it
might have been bad for you. Our big German houses, our good German
cooking--you might have got lost in the upholstery. That substantial
comfort might take the temper out of you, dull your edge. Yes," he
sighed, "I guess you were meant for the jolt of the breakers."

"I guess I'll get plenty of jolt," Thea murmured, turning to her trunk.

"I'm rather glad I'm not staying over until to-morrow," Fred reflected.
"I think it's easier for me to glide out like this. I feel now as if
everything were rather casual, anyhow. A thing like that dulls one's
feelings."

Thea, standing by her trunk, made no reply. Presently he shook himself
and rose. "Want me to put those trays in for you?"

"No, thank you. I'm not ready for them yet."

Fred strolled over to the sofa, lifted a scarf from one of the trays and
stood abstractedly drawing it through his fingers. "You've been so kind
these last few days, Thea, that I began to hope you might soften a
little; that you might ask me to come over and see you this summer."

"If you thought that, you were mistaken," she said slowly. "I've
hardened, if anything. But I shan't carry any grudge away with me, if
you mean that."

He dropped the scarf. "And there's nothing--nothing at all you'll let me
do?"

"Yes, there is one thing, and it's a good deal to ask. If I get knocked
out, or never get on, I'd like you to see that Dr. Archie gets his money
back. I'm taking three thousand dollars of his."

"Why, of course I shall. You may dismiss that from your mind. How fussy
you are about money, Thea. You make such a point of it." He turned
sharply and walked to the windows.

Thea sat down in the chair he had quitted. "It's only poor people who
feel that way about money, and who are really honest," she said gravely.
"Sometimes I think that to be really honest, you must have been so poor
that you've been tempted to steal."

"To what?"

"To steal. I used to be, when I first went to Chicago and saw all the
things in the big stores there. Never anything big, but little things,
the kind I'd never seen before and could never afford. I did take
something once, before I knew it."

Fred came toward her. For the first time she had his whole attention, in
the degree to which she was accustomed to having it. "Did you? What was
it?" he asked with interest.

"A sachet. A little blue silk bag of orris-root powder. There was a
whole counterful of them, marked down to fifty cents. I'd never seen any
before, and they seemed irresistible. I took one up and wandered about
the store with it. Nobody seemed to notice, so I carried it off."

Fred laughed. "Crazy child! Why, your things always smell of orris; is
it a penance?"

"No, I love it. But I saw that the firm didn't lose anything by me. I
went back and bought it there whenever I had a quarter to spend. I got a
lot to take to Arizona. I made it up to them."

"I'll bet you did!" Fred took her hand. "Why didn't I find you that
first winter? I'd have loved you just as you came!"

Thea shook her head. "No, you wouldn't, but you might have found me
amusing. The Harsanyis said yesterday afternoon that I wore such a funny
cape and that my shoes always squeaked. They think I've improved. I told
them it was your doing if I had, and then they looked scared."

"Did you sing for Harsanyi?"

"Yes. He thinks I've improved there, too. He said nice things to me. Oh,
he was very nice! He agrees with you about my going to Lehmann, if
she'll take me. He came out to the elevator with me, after we had said
good-bye. He said something nice out there, too, but he seemed sad."

"What was it that he said?"

"He said, 'When people, serious people, believe in you, they give you
some of their best, so--take care of it, Miss Kronborg.' Then he waved
his hands and went back."

"If you sang, I wish you had taken me along. Did you sing well?" Fred
turned from her and went back to the window. "I wonder when I shall hear
you sing again." He picked up a bunch of violets and smelled them. "You
know, your leaving me like this--well, it's almost inhuman to be able to
do it so kindly and unconditionally."

"I suppose it is. It was almost inhuman to be able to leave home,
too,--the last time, when I knew it was for good. But all the same, I
cared a great deal more than anybody else did. I lived through it. I
have no choice now. No matter how much it breaks me up, I have to go. Do
I seem to enjoy it?"

Fred bent over her trunk and picked up something which proved to be a
score, clumsily bound. "What's this? Did you ever try to sing this?" He
opened it and on the engraved title-page read Wunsch's inscription,
"EINST, O WUNDER!" He looked up sharply at Thea.

"Wunsch gave me that when he went away. I've told you about him, my old
teacher in Moonstone. He loved that opera."

Fred went toward the fireplace, the book under his arm, singing
softly:--


"EINST, O WUNDER, ENTBLUHT AUF MEINEM GRABE,
EINE BLUME DER ASCHE MEINES HERZENS;"

"You have no idea at all where he is, Thea?" He leaned against the
mantel and looked down at her.

"No, I wish I had. He may be dead by this time. That was five years ago,
and he used himself hard. Mrs. Kohler was always afraid he would die off
alone somewhere and be stuck under the prairie. When we last heard of
him, he was in Kansas."

"If he were to be found, I'd like to do something for him. I seem to get
a good deal of him from this." He opened the book again, where he kept
the place with his finger, and scrutinized the purple ink. "How like a
German! Had he ever sung the song for you?"

"No. I didn't know where the words were from until once, when Harsanyi
sang it for me, I recognized them."

Fred closed the book. "Let me see, what was your noble brakeman's name?"

Thea looked up with surprise. "Ray, Ray Kennedy."

"Ray Kennedy!" he laughed. "It couldn't well have been better! Wunsch
and Dr. Archie, and Ray, and I,"--he told them off on his
fingers,--"your whistling-posts! You haven't done so badly. We've backed
you as we could, some in our weakness and some in our might. In your
dark hours--and you'll have them--you may like to remember us." He
smiled whimsically and dropped the score into the trunk. "You are taking
that with you?"

"Surely I am. I haven't so many keepsakes that I can afford to leave
that. I haven't got many that I value so highly."

"That you value so highly?" Fred echoed her gravity playfully. "You are
delicious when you fall into your vernacular." He laughed half to
himself.

"What's the matter with that? Isn't it perfectly good English?"

"Perfectly good Moonstone, my dear. Like the readymade clothes that hang
in the windows, made to fit everybody and fit nobody, a phrase that can
be used on all occasions. Oh,"--he started across the room
again,--"that's one of the fine things about your going! You'll be with
the right sort of people and you'll learn a good, live, warm German,
that will be like yourself. You'll get a new speech full of shades and
color like your voice; alive, like your mind. It will be almost like
being born again, Thea."

She was not offended. Fred had said such things to her before, and she
wanted to learn. In the natural course of things she would never have
loved a man from whom she could not learn a great deal.

"Harsanyi said once," she remarked thoughtfully, "that if one became an
artist one had to be born again, and that one owed nothing to anybody."

"Exactly. And when I see you again I shall not see you, but your
daughter. May I?" He held up his cigarette case questioningly and then
began to smoke, taking up again the song which ran in his head:--


"DEUTLICH SCHIMMERT AUF JEDEM, PURPURBLATTCHEN, ADELAIDE!"


"I have half an hour with you yet, and then, exit Fred." He walked about
the room, smoking and singing the words under his breath. "You'll like
the voyage," he said abruptly. "That first approach to a foreign shore,
stealing up on it and finding it--there's nothing like it. It wakes up
everything that's asleep in you. You won't mind my writing to some
people in Berlin? They'll be nice to you."

"I wish you would." Thea gave a deep sigh. "I wish one could look ahead
and see what is coming to one."

"Oh, no!" Fred was smoking nervously; "that would never do. It's the
uncertainty that makes one try. You've never had any sort of chance, and
now I fancy you'll make it up to yourself. You'll find the way to let
yourself out in one long flight."

Thea put her hand on her heart. "And then drop like the rocks we used to
throw--anywhere." She left the chair and went over to the sofa, hunting
for something in the trunk trays. When she came back she found Fred
sitting in her place. "Here are some handkerchiefs of yours. I've kept
one or two. They're larger than mine and useful if one has a headache."

"Thank you. How nicely they smell of your things!" He looked at the
white squares for a moment and then put them in his pocket. He kept the
low chair, and as she stood beside him he took her hands and sat looking
intently at them, as if he were examining them for some special purpose,
tracing the long round fingers with the tips of his own. "Ordinarily,
you know, there are reefs that a man catches to and keeps his nose above
water. But this is a case by itself. There seems to be no limit as to
how much I can be in love with you. I keep going." He did not lift his
eyes from her fingers, which he continued to study with the same fervor.
"Every kind of stringed instrument there is plays in your hands, Thea,"
he whispered, pressing them to his face.

She dropped beside him and slipped into his arms, shutting her eyes and
lifting her cheek to his. "Tell me one thing," Fred whispered. "You said
that night on the boat, when I first told you, that if you could you
would crush it all up in your hands and throw it into the sea. Would
you, all those weeks?"

She shook her head.

"Answer me, would you?"

"No, I was angry then. I'm not now. I'd never give them up. Don't make
me pay too much." In that embrace they lived over again all the others.
When Thea drew away from him, she dropped her face in her hands. "You
are good to me," she breathed, "you are!"

Rising to his feet, he put his hands under her elbows and lifted her
gently. He drew her toward the door with him. "Get all you can. Be
generous with yourself. Don't stop short of splendid things. I want them
for you more than I want anything else, more than I want one splendid
thing for myself. I can't help feeling that you'll gain, somehow, by my
losing so much. That you'll gain the very thing I lose. Take care of
her, as Harsanyi said. She's wonderful!" He kissed her and went out of
the door without looking back, just as if he were coming again
to-morrow.

Thea went quickly into her bedroom. She brought out an armful of muslin
things, knelt down, and began to lay them in the trays. Suddenly she
stopped, dropped forward and leaned against the open trunk, her head on
her arms. The tears fell down on the dark old carpet. It came over her
how many people must have said good-bye and been unhappy in that room.
Other people, before her time, had hired this room to cry in. Strange
rooms and strange streets and faces, how sick at heart they made one!
Why was she going so far, when what she wanted was some familiar place
to hide in?--the rock house, her little room in Moonstone, her own bed.
Oh, how good it would be to lie down in that little bed, to cut the
nerve that kept one struggling, that pulled one on and on, to sink into
peace there, with all the family safe and happy downstairs. After all,
she was a Moonstone girl, one of the preacher's children. Everything
else was in Fred's imagination. Why was she called upon to take such
chances? Any safe, humdrum work that did not compromise her would be
better. But if she failed now, she would lose her soul. There was
nowhere to fall, after one took that step, except into abysses of
wretchedness. She knew what abysses, for she could still hear the old
man playing in the snowstorm, it was released in her like a passion of
longing. Every nerve in her body thrilled to it. It brought her to her
feet, carried her somehow to bed and into troubled sleep.

That night she taught in Moonstone again: she beat her pupils in hideous
rages, she kept on beating them. She sang at funerals, and struggled at
the piano with Harsanyi. In one dream she was looking into a hand-glass
and thinking that she was getting better-looking, when the glass began
to grow smaller and smaller and her own reflection to shrink, until she
realized that she was looking into Ray Kennedy's eyes, seeing her face
in that look of his which she could never forget. All at once the eyes
were Fred Ottenburg's, and not Ray's. All night she heard the shrieking
of trains, whistling in and out of Moonstone, as she used to hear them
in her sleep when they blew shrill in the winter air. But to-night they
were terrifying,--the spectral, fated trains that "raced with death,"
about which the old woman from the depot used to pray.

In the morning she wakened breathless after a struggle with Mrs. Livery
Johnson's daughter. She started up with a bound, threw the blankets back
and sat on the edge of the bed, her night-dress open, her long braids
hanging over her bosom, blinking at the daylight. After all, it was not
too late. She was only twenty years old, and the boat sailed at noon.
There was still time!





PART VI. KRONBORG




I

It is a glorious winter day. Denver, standing on her high plateau under
a thrilling green-blue sky, is masked in snow and glittering with
sunlight. The Capitol building is actually in armor, and throws off the
shafts of the sun until the beholder is dazzled and the outlines of the
building are lost in a blaze of reflected light. The stone terrace is a
white field over which fiery reflections dance, and the trees and bushes
are faithfully repeated in snow--on every black twig a soft, blurred
line of white. From the terrace one looks directly over to where the
mountains break in their sharp, familiar lines against the sky. Snow
fills the gorges, hangs in scarfs on the great slopes, and on the peaks
the fiery sunshine is gathered up as by a burning-glass.

Howard Archie is standing at the window of his private room in the
offices of the San Felipe Mining Company, on the sixth floor of the
Raton Building, looking off at the mountain glories of his State while
he gives dictation to his secretary. He is ten years older than when we
saw him last, and emphatically ten years more prosperous. A decade of
coming into things has not so much aged him as it has fortified,
smoothed, and assured him. His sandy hair and imperial conceal whatever
gray they harbor. He has not grown heavier, but more flexible, and his
massive shoulders carry fifty years and the control of his great mining
interests more lightly than they carried forty years and a country
practice. In short, he is one of the friends to whom we feel grateful
for having got on in the world, for helping to keep up the general
temperature and our own confidence in life. He is an acquaintance that
one would hurry to overtake and greet among a hundred. In his warm
handshake and generous smile there is the stimulating cordiality of good
fellows come into good fortune and eager to pass it on; something that
makes one think better of the lottery of life and resolve to try again.

When Archie had finished his morning mail, he turned away from the
window and faced his secretary. "Did anything come up yesterday
afternoon while I was away, T. B.?"

Thomas Burk turned over the leaf of his calendar. "Governor Alden sent
down to say that he wanted to see you before he sends his letter to the
Board of Pardons. Asked if you could go over to the State House this
morning."

Archie shrugged his shoulders. "I'll think about it."

The young man grinned.

"Anything else?" his chief continued.

T. B. swung round in his chair with a look of interest on his shrewd,
clean-shaven face. "Old Jasper Flight was in, Dr. Archie. I never
expected to see him alive again. Seems he's tucked away for the winter
with a sister who's a housekeeper at the Oxford. He's all crippled up
with rheumatism, but as fierce after it as ever. Wants to know if you or
the company won't grub-stake him again. Says he's sure of it this time;
had located something when the snow shut down on him in December. He
wants to crawl out at the first break in the weather, with that same old
burro with the split ear. He got somebody to winter the beast for him.
He's superstitious about that burro, too; thinks it's divinely guided.
You ought to hear the line of talk he put up here yesterday; said when
he rode in his carriage, that burro was a-going to ride along with him."

Archie laughed. "Did he leave you his address?"

"He didn't neglect anything," replied the clerk cynically.

"Well, send him a line and tell him to come in again. I like to hear
him. Of all the crazy prospectors I've ever known, he's the most
interesting, because he's really crazy. It's a religious conviction with
him, and with most of 'em it's a gambling fever or pure vagrancy. But
Jasper Flight believes that the Almighty keeps the secret of the silver
deposits in these hills, and gives it away to the deserving. He's a
downright noble figure. Of course I'll stake him! As long as he can
crawl out in the spring. He and that burro are a sight together. The
beast is nearly as white as Jasper; must be twenty years old."

"If you stake him this time, you won't have to again," said T. B.
knowingly. "He'll croak up there, mark my word. Says he never ties the
burro at night now, for fear he might be called sudden, and the beast
would starve. I guess that animal could eat a lariat rope, all right,
and enjoy it."

"I guess if we knew the things those two have eaten, and haven't eaten,
in their time, T. B., it would make us vegetarians." The doctor sat down
and looked thoughtful. "That's the way for the old man to go. It would
be pretty hard luck if he had to die in a hospital. I wish he could turn
up something before he cashes in. But his kind seldom do; they're
bewitched. Still, there was Stratton. I've been meeting Jasper Flight,
and his side meat and tin pans, up in the mountains for years, and I'd
miss him. I always halfway believe the fairy tales he spins me. Old
Jasper Flight," Archie murmured, as if he liked the name or the picture
it called up.

A clerk came in from the outer office and handed Archie a card. He
sprang up and exclaimed, "Mr. Ottenburg? Bring him in."

Fred Ottenburg entered, clad in a long, fur-lined coat, holding a
checked-cloth hat in his hand, his cheeks and eyes bright with the
outdoor cold. The two men met before Archie's desk and their handclasp
was longer than friendship prompts except in regions where the blood
warms and quickens to meet the dry cold. Under the general keyingup of
the altitude, manners take on a heartiness, a vivacity, that is one
expression of the half-unconscious excitement which Colorado people miss
when they drop into lower strata of air. The heart, we are told, wears
out early in that high atmosphere, but while it pumps it sends out no
sluggish stream. Our two friends stood gripping each other by the hand
and smiling.

"When did you get in, Fred? And what have you come for?" Archie gave him
a quizzical glance.

"I've come to find out what you think you're doing out here," the
younger man declared emphatically. "I want to get next, I do. When can
you see me?"

"Anything on to-night? Then suppose you dine with me. Where can I pick
you up at five-thirty?"

"Bixby's office, general freight agent of the Burlington." Ottenburg
began to button his overcoat and drew on his gloves. "I've got to have
one shot at you before I go, Archie. Didn't I tell you Pinky Alden was a
cheap squirt?"

Alden's backer laughed and shook his head. "Oh, he's worse than that,
Fred. It isn't polite to mention what he is, outside of the Arabian
Nights. I guessed you'd come to rub it into me."

Ottenburg paused, his hand on the doorknob, his high color challenging
the doctor's calm. "I'm disgusted with you, Archie, for training with
such a pup. A man of your experience!"

"Well, he's been an experience," Archie muttered. "I'm not coy about
admitting it, am I?"

Ottenburg flung open the door. "Small credit to you. Even the women are
out for capital and corruption, I hear. Your Governor's done more for
the United Breweries in six months than I've been able to do in six
years. He's the lily-livered sort we're looking for. Good-morning."

That afternoon at five o'clock Dr. Archie emerged from the State House
after his talk with Governor Alden, and crossed the terrace under a
saffron sky. The snow, beaten hard, was blue in the dusk; a day of
blinding sunlight had not even started a thaw. The lights of the city
twinkled pale below him in the quivering violet air, and the dome of the
State House behind him was still red with the light from the west.
Before he got into his car, the doctor paused to look about him at the
scene of which he never tired. Archie lived in his own house on Colfax
Avenue, where he had roomy grounds and a rose garden and a conservatory.
His housekeeping was done by three Japanese boys, devoted and
resourceful, who were able to manage Archie's dinner parties, to see
that he kept his engagements, and to make visitors who stayed at the
house so comfortable that they were always loath to go away.

Archie had never known what comfort was until he became a widower,
though with characteristic delicacy, or dishonesty, he insisted upon
accrediting his peace of mind to the San Felipe, to Time, to anything
but his release from Mrs. Archie.

Mrs. Archie died just before her husband left Moonstone and came to
Denver to live, six years ago. The poor woman's fight against dust was
her undoing at last. One summer day when she was rubbing the parlor
upholstery with gasoline,--the doctor had often forbidden her to use it
on any account, so that was one of the pleasures she seized upon in his
absence,--an explosion occurred. Nobody ever knew exactly how it
happened, for Mrs. Archie was dead when the neighbors rushed in to save
her from the burning house. She must have inhaled the burning gas and
died instantly.

Moonstone severity relented toward her somewhat after her death. But
even while her old cronies at Mrs. Smiley's millinery store said that it
was a terrible thing, they added that nothing but a powerful explosive
COULD have killed Mrs. Archie, and that it was only right the doctor
should have a chance.

Archie's past was literally destroyed when his wife died. The house
burned to the ground, and all those material reminders which have such
power over people disappeared in an hour. His mining interests now took
him to Denver so often that it seemed better to make his headquarters
there. He gave up his practice and left Moonstone for good. Six months
afterward, while Dr. Archie was living at the Brown Palace Hotel, the
San Felipe mine began to give up that silver hoard which old Captain
Harris had always accused it of concealing, and San Felipe headed the
list of mining quotations in every daily paper, East and West. In a few
years Dr. Archie was a very rich man. His mine was such an important
item in the mineral output of the State, and Archie had a hand in so
many of the new industries of Colorado and New Mexico, that his
political influence was considerable. He had thrown it all, two years
ago, to the new reform party, and had brought about the election of a
governor of whose conduct he was now heartily ashamed. His friends
believed that Archie himself had ambitious political plans.




II

WHEN Ottenburg and his host reached the house on Colfax Avenue, they
went directly to the library, a long double room on the second floor
which Archie had arranged exactly to his own taste. It was full of books
and mounted specimens of wild game, with a big writing-table at either
end, stiff, old-fashioned engravings, heavy hangings and deep
upholstery.

When one of the Japanese boys brought the cocktails, Fred turned from
the fine specimen of peccoray he had been examining and said, "A man is
an owl to live in such a place alone, Archie. Why don't you marry? As
for me, just because I can't marry, I find the world full of charming,
unattached women, any one of whom I could fit up a house for with
alacrity."

"You're more knowing than I." Archie spoke politely. "I'm not very wide
awake about women. I'd be likely to pick out one of the uncomfortable
ones--and there are a few of them, you know." He drank his cocktail and
rubbed his hands together in a friendly way. "My friends here have
charming wives, and they don't give me a chance to get lonely. They are
very kind to me, and I have a great many pleasant friendships."

Fred put down his glass. "Yes, I've always noticed that women have
confidence in you. You have the doctor's way of getting next. And you
enjoy that kind of thing?"

"The friendship of attractive women? Oh, dear, yes! I depend upon it a
great deal."

The butler announced dinner, and the two men went downstairs to the
dining-room. Dr. Archie's dinners were always good and well served, and
his wines were excellent.

"I saw the Fuel and Iron people to-day," Ottenburg said, looking up from
his soup. "Their heart is in the right place. I can't see why in the
mischief you ever got mixed up with that reform gang, Archie. You've got
nothing to reform out here. The situation has always been as simple as
two and two in Colorado; mostly a matter of a friendly understanding."

"Well,"--Archie spoke tolerantly,--"some of the young fellows seemed to
have red-hot convictions, and I thought it was better to let them try
their ideas out."

Ottenburg shrugged his shoulders. "A few dull young men who haven't
ability enough to play the old game the old way, so they want to put on
a new game which doesn't take so much brains and gives away more
advertising that's what your anti-saloon league and vice commission
amounts to. They provide notoriety for the fellows who can't distinguish
themselves at running a business or practicing law or developing an
industry. Here you have a mediocre lawyer with no brains and no
practice, trying to get a look-in on something. He comes up with the
novel proposition that the prostitute has a hard time of it, puts his
picture in the paper, and the first thing you know, he's a celebrity. He
gets the rake-off and she's just where she was before. How could you
fall for a mouse-trap like Pink Alden, Archie?"

Dr. Archie laughed as he began to carve. "Pink seems to get under your
skin. He's not worth talking about. He's gone his limit. People won't
read about his blameless life any more. I knew those interviews he gave
out would cook him. They were a last resort. I could have stopped him,
but by that time I'd come to the conclusion that I'd let the reformers
down. I'm not against a general shaking-up, but the trouble with Pinky's
crowd is they never get beyond a general writing-up. We gave them a
chance to do something, and they just kept on writing about each other
and what temptations they had overcome."

While Archie and his friend were busy with Colorado politics, the
impeccable Japanese attended swiftly and intelligently to his duties,
and the dinner, as Ottenburg at last remarked, was worthy of more
profitable conversation.

"So it is," the doctor admitted. "Well, we'll go upstairs for our coffee
and cut this out. Bring up some cognac and arak, Tai," he added as he
rose from the table.

They stopped to examine a moose's head on the stairway, and when they
reached the library the pine logs in the fireplace had been lighted, and
the coffee was bubbling before the hearth. Tai placed two chairs before
the fire and brought a tray of cigarettes.

"Bring the cigars in my lower desk drawer, boy," the doctor directed.
"Too much light in here, isn't there, Fred? Light the lamp there on my
desk, Tai." He turned off the electric glare and settled himself deep
into the chair opposite Ottenburg's.

"To go back to our conversation, doctor," Fred began while he waited for
the first steam to blow off his coffee; "why don't you make up your mind
to go to Washington? There'd be no fight made against you. I needn't say
the United Breweries would back you. There'd be some KUDOS coming to us,
too; backing a reform candidate."

Dr. Archie measured his length in his chair and thrust his large boots
toward the crackling pitch-pine. He drank his coffee and lit a big black
cigar while his guest looked over the assortment of cigarettes on the
tray. "You say why don't I," the doctor spoke with the deliberation of a
man in the position of having several courses to choose from, "but, on
the other hand, why should I?" He puffed away and seemed, through his
half-closed eyes, to look down several long roads with the intention of
luxuriously rejecting all of them and remaining where he was. "I'm sick
of politics. I'm disillusioned about serving my crowd, and I don't
particularly want to serve yours. Nothing in it that I particularly
want; and a man's not effective in politics unless he wants something
for himself, and wants it hard. I can reach my ends by straighter roads.
There are plenty of things to keep me busy. We haven't begun to develop
our resources in this State; we haven't had a look in on them yet.
That's the only thing that isn't fake--making men and machines go, and
actually turning out a product."

The doctor poured himself some white cordial and looked over the little
glass into the fire with an expression which led Ottenburg to believe
that he was getting at something in his own mind. Fred lit a cigarette
and let his friend grope for his idea.

"My boys, here," Archie went on, "have got me rather interested in
Japan. Think I'll go out there in the spring, and come back the other
way, through Siberia. I've alw9
